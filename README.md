# Remix & Drizzle todo app
Super duper basic todo app built using Remix, Drizzle, AuthJS, etc


Built as a fun little project to experiment with a few things I've been wanting to try out

### Things experimented with:
- Bun
- Remix
- Drizzle
- Tailwind V4.0
- AuthJS

# Running it
1. Gotta install everything with `bun install`

2. Create a `.env` file with the following variables:
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/database
SESSION_SECRET=SuperDuperSecretForYourSession
```

3. Then just run `bun run dev`

Nice and easy
